## Summary

Defines the block generation interval, mining reward structure, and the Proof-of-Work consensus system used in the Nureon network.

## Specification

- Block Time: 10 minutes
- Initial Block Reward: 100 ELC
- Consensus Mechanism: Proof-of-Work (SHA-256)

## Notes

Mining difficulty adjusts periodically to maintain the 10-minute block interval.
